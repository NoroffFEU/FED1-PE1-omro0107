This is a school project where I created a website using HTML, CSS and JS.

## Description

This is a Blog where all content is fetched using API. I designed the website using FIGMA, then I built it using HTML for structure, CSS for styling and JS for interactivity and fetcing API. I also used Postman for API calls and sending content to the API. Two of the pages are only available when logged in: Edit post and Create post. The possibility to delete posts are also available when logged in. At the Home page you will find a carousel containing the three latest posts, and a grid with sorting function to see the 12 latest posts.
